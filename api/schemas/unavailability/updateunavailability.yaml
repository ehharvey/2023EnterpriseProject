  an update to an unavailability. this could be a maintenance window, a booking, or something else.
  this is the base type for all unavailability updates.
  as a result, it does not have an id, because it is not a complete unavailability.
  it also has no required fields, because only need to send a fragment of this data
  to update an unavailability.
