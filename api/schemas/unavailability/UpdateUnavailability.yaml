  An update to an unavailability. This could be a maintenance window, a booking, or something else.
  This is the base type for all unavailability updates.
  As a result, it does not have an ID, because it is not a complete unavailability.
  It also has no required fields, because only need to send a fragment of this data
  to update an unavailability.
