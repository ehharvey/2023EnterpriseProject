Welcome to Reserva! This repository is for a web-based room booking system built with microservices. If you're new to the project, here's a guide to getting started.

# Clone the Repository
To get started, you'll need to clone the repository. You can do this using your preferred Git client or by running the following command in your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/ehharvey/Reserva.git
```

# Set up your Environment
We have included a `devcontainer` configuration JSON for VS Code or GitHub Codespaces. This configuration will set up a development environment with all the necessary tools and dependencies.

To use the `devcontainer` configuration, you'll need to have Docker and Visual Studio Code (or GitHub Codespaces) installed. Once you have these tools installed, open the cloned repository in VS Code and follow the prompts to build the container.

# Define Microservice APIs
As a team, we are currently working on defining microservice APIs. Take a look at the api directory to see the existing APIs and their specifications. If you need to add a new API or modify an existing one, make sure to document the changes in the OpenAPI specification file and discuss them with the team.

# Create a Mockup UI
We are also working on creating a mockup UI using React (Create React App). You can find the UI code in the client directory. To run the UI locally, navigate to the client directory and run the following commands:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will start a development server that you can access in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

# GitFlow
Finally, we are using GitFlow to manage our development process. Make sure you are familiar with GitFlow and follow the guidelines outlined in the repository wiki for reviewing pull requests and merging branches.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out to your team members or create an issue on the repository. We're all here to learn and collaborate together!
